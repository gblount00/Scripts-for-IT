Overview:
Multi Tool is a convenient program designed to help you open applications with administrative privileges without the need to enter your credentials each time. The goal is to save you time, reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries, and ultimately make your work easier!

How It Works:
Rest assured, your password is completely secure! Neither the .bat nor .exe files of Multi Tool save or store your username or password in any form. The script simply instructs your computer to launch a specific program by providing the necessary information, including the program's name and its directory. If you wish to add or modify programs, this information can be easily adjusted within the script.

Differences between .bat and .exe:
In simple terms, the .exe file provides a graphical user interface (GUI), while the .bat file operates through a command line interface (CLI). The GUI allows you to easily click on buttons to open programs, whereas the CLI requires you to type commands to launch the corresponding applications.

Regardless of your choice, both options must be run as an administrator to function correctly.
